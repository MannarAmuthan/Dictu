### System.mkdir(string, number: mode -> optional)

Make directory.
Returns a Result type and on success will unwrap nil.

It can take an optional number argument that specifies the mode. If a mode is not passed, the directory will be created with `0777` permissions.

The actual permissions is modified by the process umask, which typically is S_IWGRP\|S_IWOTH (octal 022).

```cs
var
  S_IRWXU = System.S_IRWXU,
  S_IRGRP = System.S_IRGRP,
  S_IXGRP = System.S_IXGRP,
  S_IROTH = System.S_IROTH,
  S_IXOTH = System.S_IXOTH;

System.mkdir(dir, S_IRWXU|S_IRGRP|S_IXGRP|S_IXOTH|S_IROTH);
```

### System.access(string, number)

Check user's permissions for a file
Returns a Result type and on success will unwrap nil.

**Note:** This method and the F_OK\|X_OK\|W_OK\|R_OK constants are not available on windows systems.

```cs
var F_OK = System.F_OK;

System.access("/", F_OK);
```

### System.rmdir(string)

Remove directory.

Returns a Result type and on success will unwrap nil.

```cs
System.rmdir(dir);
```

### System.remove(string)

Delete a file from filesystem.

Returns a Result type and on success will unwrap nil.

```cs
System.remove(file);
```

### System.getpid()

Returns the process ID (PID) of the calling process as a number.

```cs
System.getpid();
```

### System.getppid()

**Note:** This is not available on windows systems.

```cs
System.getppid();
```

### System.getuid()

Returns the real user ID of the calling process as a number.

**Note:** This is not available on windows systems.

```cs
System.getuid();
```

### System.geteuid()

Returns the effective user ID of the calling process as a number.

**Note:** This is not available on windows systems.

```cs
System.geteuid();
```

### System.getgid()

Returns the real group ID of the calling process as a number.

**Note:** This is not available on windows systems.

```cs
System.getgid();
```

### System.getegid()

Returns the effective group ID of the calling process as a number.

**Note:** This is not available on windows systems.

```cs
System.getegid();
```

### System.getCWD()

Get the current working directory of the Dictu process.

Returns a Result type and on success will unwrap a string.

```cs
System.getCWD().unwrap(); // '/Some/Path/To/A/Directory'
```

### System.setCWD(string)

Set current working directory of the Dictu process.

Returns a Result type and on success will unwrap nil.

```cs
if (!System.setCWD('/').success()) {
    print("failed to change directory");
}
```

### System.sleep(number)

Sleep pauses execution of the program for a given amount of time in seconds.

```cs
System.sleep(3); // Pauses execution for 3 seconds
```

### System.clock()

Returns number of clock ticks since the start of the program as a number, useful for benchmarks.

```cs
System.clock();
```

### System.time()

Returns UNIX timestamp as a number.

```cs
